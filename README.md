An app for tracking, watching and reading all about anime and manga!

Ever wanted to have everything in one place? Tracking your progress, watching anime, and reading manga. And so, I wanted to solve this problem with this project. This app allows you to sync with your AniList account and manage your library directly on the app itself, and also includes the schedules of the currently airing anime so you never miss an episode, and most importantly, watch or read your favorite anime or manga from various sources without having to search each of them!

> **Note**: The project's development will be slow because I need to work with my studies for my national exams that I will be taking this year...
