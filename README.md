A multi-purpose app for tracking anime/manga, watching/reading content and feeding the latest news!

Ever wanted to have everything in one place? Watching anime, tracking your progress, read news about your favorite manga. And so, I wanted to solve that problem with this project, this app allows you to sync with your favorite tracking services, get up-to-date with the latest news about anime or manga, get the schedule of an anime so you never miss an episode, and most importantly, watch or read your favorite anime or manga from various sources without having to search each of them!

Also, this project development will be slow as I only work on it during my free time!  (studying for exams succ :<)...
