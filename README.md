An app for tracking, watching and reading all about anime and manga!

Ever wanted to have everything in one place? Tracking your progress, watching anime, reading manga and so on. And I thought that I wanted to solve this problem, and this project came to life. This app allows you to sync with your [AniList](https://anilist.co) account and manage your library directly on the app itself, and also includes the schedules of the currently airing anime (powered by [AniChart](https://anichart.net)) so you never miss an episode, and most importantly, watch or read your favorite anime or manga from various sources without having to search each of them!

> **Note**: This project is currently on [Hiatus](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hiatus) as I am currently studying for my exams.
